    <h2>Step 1: Get the .ISO and write it to the disk<h2>
    <p>For this step, you will need to download the image for the operating system you want to download. I reccomend Ubuntu, for which you can 		get the image from <a>here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Then, you will have to restore the image to the USB drive. For this you will have to use additional software.</p>
